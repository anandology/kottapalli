Here we will see the code to get all the pages from old infogami and to push all the new data to new infogami.

different directories are..
1.  get_links - to get the  paths file to pull all the pages from old infogami.
2. old_pages  - It will have all the pages pulled from old infogami.
 How to pull ? We will use 'pages' plugin to pull with paths file(We will get this from  get_links code).


3. Now we have all the queries in old_pages directory. Now we have to convert them into a new query format. run convert_query.py to get new queries.

run this command with first argument as directory name of old query files and file to write new query list.
	python convert_query.py old_pages fileTosavequeryeList

4. Now we have new queries list. We have to push all these queries to new infobase

Run the write_query.py script with first argument as a file name that should have list of queries
!!
python write_query.py infobaseQuerylistFile
!! 

It keeps data in database. In write_query.py we have to configure database and infogami settings.
